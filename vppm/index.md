## Privacy Policy & Terms of Use for VoicePresso Password Manager

**Last Updated:** November 1, 2025

## Privacy Policy

This extension (VoicePresso Password Manager) was built on a **privacy-first** philosophy. We do not sell your data.

### Your Master Password

Your Master Password is the single most important piece of information.
* It is used to derive the encryption key for your vault.
* It is **never stored** on your computer.
* It is **never transmitted** to us or any third party.
* We, the developers, **cannot see, access, or recover** your Master Password.

### Data Storage: Your 100% Local Vault

By default, this extension is a 100% local tool.

* **What We Store:** All your saved entries (passwords, usernames, etc.) are encrypted using strong **AES-GCM encryption**. This encrypted data is stored *only on your computer* using the browser's native `chrome.storage.local` API.
* **What We DON'T Collect:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your browsing history or the personal data you save in your vault.

### Optional Future Features (The "Opt-In" Cloud)

In the future, we may offer **optional** premium features, such as multi-device sync or cloud backup.
* These features will require you to create an account and will involve transmitting your **encrypted** vault to a secure server.
* These features will be **opt-in only**. If you choose not to use them, your vault will **never** leave your device, and the "100% Local" policy will always apply to you.

### The One Network Request

This extension makes one (1) anonymous network request approximately every 6 hours to a file hosted on GitHub Gist.
* **Purpose:** To load content for the "Promo" section in the popup. This allows us to share news or promote our other free extensions.
* **What it sends:** This is a one-way "read" request. It **does not send** any of your personal data, passwords, or browsing habits.

By installing and using "VoicePresso Password Manager," you agree to the following terms.
### 1. License and Restrictions

We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use this extension for its intended purpose. You agree **not** to:

* **Reverse-engineer,** decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or underlying algorithms of the extension.

* **Resell,** rent, lease, or distribute the extension or create a competing product based on its features or code.

All rights, title, and interest in the extension are and will remain the exclusive property of the developer.

### 2. This is a Tool, Not a Service

This extension is provided as a local software tool. It is not a cloud service. We do not manage your data, and unless you opt-in to a future cloud feature, we provide no account or cloud backup.

### 3. Your Security is Your Responsibility

The security of this extension is designed to protect your data from outside attackers. It cannot protect you from your own actions. You are solely responsible for the following:

* **The Master Password:** We cannot recover your Master Password. It is impossible. **If you forget your Master Password, your encrypted data will be permanently and irretrievably lost.** You are solely responsible for storing your Master Password in a safe, secure place.
* **The Exported Vault File:** This extension provides a feature to export your vault as a plain-text, **unencrypted** JSON file. This file is for your own backup convenience. You are solely responsible for the security of this exported file. Do not email it, share it, or leave it in an unsecured location.
* **Phishing:** The extension's autofill feature matches the exact hostname (e.g., `google.com`). It is your responsibility to ensure you are on the correct, legitimate website before saving or filling credentials.

### 4. Limitation of Liability

This extension is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind. In no event shall the developer be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, including any loss of data, loss of access, or other damages arising from the use of this software.

### 5. Cross-Promotion

This is a free extension. You acknowledge that as part of its use, the extension will display promotions for other extensions or products from the same developer, as described in the Privacy Policy.
